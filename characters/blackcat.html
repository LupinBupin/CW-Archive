        <h1>Lore</h1>
        <p>
            There was a nuke that made the previous unnamed mayor resign and give interim mayor to The Black Cat (6/25/22)<br>
            The Black Cat opens The Black Cat Express with his new mayorship (10/22/22)<br>
            The Black Cat gets more and more overstepping, setting up a giant billboard in front of the Japan Shrine, starting the feud with Shrine Maiden (Lupin)<br>
            The Black Cat "purchases" the Japan Shrine area from the city for $10 million dollars through a lawfirm called The Black Hat Lawyers, run by Mr. Hatter (DarknessOfDark) (5/6/23)<br>
            He uses that to create a city project to build The Black Cat 2 over the shrine grounds, and succeeds, but during the opening ceremony the entire thing gets set ablaze (6/3/23)<br>
            Japan Shrine is rebuilt, and The Black Cat essentially gives up on building up there, and instead wants to capitalize on the Shrine Maiden being a demon; building a wall around the shrine and putting a ticket booth to sell tickets as if it were a zoo during Halloween (10/7/23)<br>
            It rains and Japan Shrine got flooded due to lack of irrigation, so the walls are taken down (Was "agreed" on happening sometime in January 2024, wasn't during a Citywide)<br>
            The Black Cat's interim mayor term is coming to a close, so he starts advertising his mayorship and a debate is held, with Mr. Beast (Jeff), Crackhead (Blurple), and the shrine maiden (Lupin) running against him. A mayoral debate and actual Google Form vote is held (2/10/24)<br>
            Mr. Beast wins the mayor election, but turns to be evil and blows up both the shrine and The Black Cat Express. As a last ditch effort to escape responsibility, he runs the "touch the LPD station for mayor" challenge and The Black Cat makes it first (3/2/24)<br>
            Mr. Beast is taken into custody and code 0'd by SLRT into the river (3/2/24)<br>
            The Black Cat somehow legally becomes mayor through that, and builds/purchases The Black Cat 2 (2), which he runs now, with The Black Cat Express for lease (5/4/24)<br>
            The Black Cat is able to sell The Black Cat Express for $250k to The Medic (OmegaDiamond) who runs a medic cafe out of it.<br>
            The Shrine Maiden takes down The Black Cat's billboard in front of the shrine out of anger, it landing beside the bridge in the river. (8/3/24)<br>
            TBC still owns the airspace of the sold Express however, so puts up another gigantic billboard in the dead center of the place since the previous was felled (10/5/24)<br>
            Casey Chestnuts (StarsStellar) offers to be assistant mayor, which TBC agrees to so he doesn't have to work as much. An "Office of Mayor cabinet" starts to form (11/2/24)<br>
            John Wizardman is added to cabinet after TBC realizes he can spawn money (which only exists for 2-3 years at a time before disappearing). Casey is not happy with this, and successfully encourages John to instead be the Fire Chief to put out fires with water magic instead<br>
            The Mayor cabinet pulls the old felled billboard out of the river, which is now somehow standing again in a heavily disheveled state (4/5/25)<br>
